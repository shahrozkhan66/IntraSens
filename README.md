## Overview

This repository contains Matlab and C++ implementation of the algorithm framework of the proposed intra-sensitivity approach. 

### Extended Abstract
Extended Abstract:

Parametric Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) investigates the sensitivity of parameters, defining the design space of a shape-optimisation problem, for tackling the challenges of the curse of dimensionality or decreasing the uncertainty in design’s performance. This is critical for complex engineering problems, especially those involving free-form shapes. Among the difficulties a robust PSA has to handle is related to the fact that a parameter can be sensitive within a certain local region of the design space but become insensitive in some other regions. Therefore, setting an applicable design space becomes a difficult and unnerving task for robust and desired results. As sensitivity analysis within a non-viable design space can be futile; either resulting in the elimination of an important parameter during dimension reduction or wastage of computational resources if uncertainty reduction is carried out with inaccurately classified sensitive parameters.
